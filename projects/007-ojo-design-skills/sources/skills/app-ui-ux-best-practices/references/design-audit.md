# Design Audit Reference

Quality gate reference for comprehensive design review. The final checkpoint before shipping.

---

## Audit Overview

Design audit operates in **documentation mode**: finds and reports issues with severity levels, then recommends which skill/reference to use for fixes.

### Severity Levels

**Critical (Must Fix):**
- Blocks shipping
- 3+ AI detection traits
- Failed text contrast
- Broken keyboard navigation
- Non-functional core interactions

**High Priority:**
- Should fix before shipping
- 2+ interaction failures
- Visual inconsistency between sections
- Missing focus indicators
- Poor mobile responsiveness

**Medium Priority:**
- Fix if time permits
- Single interaction issue
- Typography hierarchy unclear
- Missing hover states
- Performance optimization needed

**Low Priority:**
- Polish items
- Minor spacing inconsistencies
- Secondary content clarity
- Animation refinement
- Micro-interaction polish

---

## Audit 0: Register Fidelity

Before checking quality details, verify the output is faithful to the evidence-derived register declaration (`Energy`, `Finish`, `Density`, `Weight`, `Seriousness`). This audit is **two-way** — there is no "correct" register, only faithful or unfaithful execution:

- [ ] The declared register dials exist and cite evidence (product subject, audience, brand voice). Missing declaration with mood-adjective-only rationale ("premium feel", "克制高级") = **High**.
- [ ] Declared loud/raw/dense but delivered polished: soft shadows, 12-16px radii, generous whitespace, subtle gradients where the direction called for hard borders, collision, grain = **Critical** (the design was normalized back to the AI default register).
- [ ] Declared quiet/polished/sparse but delivered gritty: noise overlays, torn edges, brutalist borders forced onto a product whose evidence says quiet = **Critical** (same failure, opposite direction).
- [ ] Register consistency across screens: hero is loud/raw but settings/forms silently revert to generic polished defaults (or vice versa) without a deliberate quiet-zone decision = **High**.
- [ ] Accessibility floor holds regardless of register: contrast ratios, tap targets, focus indicators, and text legibility are never sacrificed to either grit or minimalism = **Critical** if violated.

**Quiet/polished output for a meditation, luxury, or archival product with cited evidence passes this audit unconditionally.** The failure is unearned defaults, not any specific register.

## Audit 5: Anti-AI Detection

The most critical audit. Detects AI-generated aesthetics that destroy credibility.

### Quick Detection (30 seconds)

Check these 5 traits first:

1. **Background color**: Is it purple-black (#0D0B1A, #1A1625)?
2. **Primary color treatment**: Is it AI-default purple/violet on dark (#A78BFA, #8B5CF6) without brand/reference justification?
3. **Glassmorphism**: Blur + glow border combination present?
4. **Gradient buttons**: Purple→blue or pink→cyan gradients?
5. **Overall vibe**: Sci-fi movie interface or real product?

**If 3+ traits match: STOP. Recommend DELETE AND RESTART.**

### Comprehensive Detection Checklist

**Color Signatures:**
- [ ] No deep purple/blue-black backgrounds
- [ ] No AI-default purple/violet primary on dark or purple-blue treatment
- [ ] No pink→cyan gradients
- [ ] No neon colors (#00FFFF, #FF00FF, #00FF00)
- [ ] No colored border glow on dark backgrounds
- [ ] No blue + purple color pairing

**Visual Effects:**
- [ ] No glassmorphism with glow borders
- [ ] No cheap neon glow on icons
- [ ] No gradient fills within icons
- [ ] No outer glow on any element
- [ ] No multiple gradient overlays
- [ ] No "holographic" or iridescent effects

**Layout Patterns:**
- [ ] No "cyberpunk dashboard" aesthetic
- [ ] No identical card grids (icon+heading+text × 6)
- [ ] No hexagonal UI elements
- [ ] Full-height hero (100vh) is ALLOWED for immersive storytelling, but ensure scroll affordance
- [ ] Grid patterns or dot matrices are ALLOWED for DevTools, Neo-brutalism, or technical products
- [ ] **Layout Mode Consistency**: check against the declared `theme.layoutMode`:
  - `EDITORIAL` — MUST use at least one non-linear section (Bento Grid, asymmetric columns, overlapping elements, or editorial rhythm). Pure flex-column = FAIL.
  - `UTILITY` — linear layout allowed, but MUST be elevated through typography, deliberate spacing rhythm, or considered micro-interactions (in the declared register's vocabulary). Visually bland linear = FAIL.
  - `HYBRID` — MUST contain at least one heterogeneous layout zone (e.g. featured hero or bento section) AND at least one clean linear section. A layout that is entirely one mode = FAIL.
  - If `theme.layoutMode` is absent, infer from product type (consumer/lifestyle → EDITORIAL rules apply; B2B/tool → UTILITY rules apply).

**Typography:**
- [ ] No "futuristic" fonts (Orbitron, Exo, Space Grotesk as body)
- [ ] Not 4+ type styles above fold
- [ ] No gradient text
- [ ] No neon text on dark backgrounds

**Icons & Images:**
- [ ] No emoji as functional icons (🚀 📊 💡)
- [ ] No sparkle decorations (✨) around elements
- [ ] No AI-generated cartoon avatars
- [ ] No mixed icon libraries (inconsistent styles)
- [ ] Every meaningful image slot uses or specifies a real source: user/brand asset, official media, websearch/image search, Dribbble/Behance/Mobbin/UINotes artwork, Unsplash/Pexels/Wikimedia-style photography, product screenshot, user-content data, or generated bitmap
- [ ] Images depict the actual subject/category/state; no gray boxes, "Image" labels, abstract gradient placeholders, generic laptop mockups, or dark blurred stock backgrounds
- [ ] Image specs include crop/focal point, alt text, and fallback behavior

### The Golden Rule Test

> **If it looks like a sci-fi movie interface, DELETE IT AND START OVER.**

**Compare side-by-side with:** the reference system you picked from the candidate pool (one of: Notion / Spotify / Arc / Figma / Linear / Stripe / Vercel / Things 3 / Raycast / Superhuman / Apple HIG / Material 3) — not always the same 2-3 names.

**If it looks more like a Dribbble "concept" than a real product:** AI-generated.

### Common Issues

| Issue | Severity | Fix Reference |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| 3+ AI detection traits | Critical | DELETE AND RESTART (visual-system hub) |
| Purple primary color | Critical | visual-tokens.md (Banned Colors) |
| Cyberpunk aesthetic | Critical | anti-patterns.md (AI Detection) |
| 1-2 AI traits | High | design-refine.md or targeted fixes |

## Quick Pre-Flight Checklist

Fast pass before full audit. Use this for rapid QA during design process.

### 30-Second Scan

- [ ] Background NOT purple-black
- [ ] Primary color NOT purple/violet
- [ ] NO glassmorphism + glow borders
- [ ] Buttons solid colors, NOT gradients
- [ ] Looks like a real shipped product (the execution standard of the reference system or genre you selected — a shipped gig poster site and a shipped SaaS dashboard both count)
- [ ] Register faithful: output matches the declared register dials, not smoothed toward polished nor roughened toward gritty (Audit 0)

**If any fail:** Run full AI detection audit.

### 2-Minute Interaction Test

- [ ] Hover 3 elements: do they increase visibility?
- [ ] Tab through page: focus indicators visible?
- [ ] Press a button: does it provide tactile feedback?
- [ ] Scroll the page: native browser behavior?
- [ ] Check contrast: body text readable?

**If 2+ fail:** Run full audit.

- After completing the visual design pipeline
- Before final handoff to development
- After AI-generated design output (mandatory)

**Optional Usage:**
- During design process for quick checks (use Quick Pre-Flight Checklist)
- When stakeholders request "design review"
- When design feels "off" but you can't pinpoint why

**When NOT to Use:**
- Early in design process (too premature)
- For minor iteration/tweaks (use Quick Pre-Flight instead)

---

## The Golden Rule (Repeated for Emphasis)

> **If it looks like a sci-fi movie interface, a gaming dashboard, or something from Blade Runner — DELETE IT AND START OVER.**
>
> Professional design is **invisible**. It serves the content, not the aesthetic ego of the designer (or AI).
>
> **Reference products to study** (rotate across the pool; do NOT lock to the first 2-3 names): Notion, Spotify, Arc, Things 3, Figma, Airbnb, Raycast, Superhuman, Apple HIG, Material 3, Linear, Stripe, Vercel.
>
> **Discard as references:** Dribbble "dark dashboard" shots, Behance templates, AI-generated portfolio sites.
