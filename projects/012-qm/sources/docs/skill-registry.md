# Skill registry (Phase A)

Import skills from a **git repo of `SKILL.md` files** into the governed skill store — no code change,
no image rebuild. An admin registers a _pack_, browses it, and imports skills **org-wide**; the
skills then show on the admin Skills page and materialize onto boxes through the normal path.

## How it works

```
git pack ──fetch(pinned ref)──▶ general normalizer ──▶ planIngest (classify) ──▶ importPack
                                                                                      │
                                                          create→review→publish (shared upsert)
                                                                                      ▼
                                                          org-scope SkillStore ──▶ materialize ──▶ box
```

- **One general normalizer** (`src/skills/normalize.ts`) maps any repo's frontmatter dialect onto the
  canonical manifest via an alias table + ignore-unknowns + safe defaults. **No per-repo code** — a
  repo's specifics are declarative `config` on the pack (`skillGlobs` / `exclude` / `fieldOverrides`).
- **Eligibility** (org import): a skill is imported only if its scope hint is org-shareable
  (`company` / `both` / `org` / `shared` / …). Excluded with a visible reason: `scope` (personal/missing),
  `private` (owner-only flags or a `THE-AGENT-ONLY` body), `collision` (name already owned by a
  different pack / native seed), `binary-asset`, `malformed`.
- **Pinned** in Phase A: an install is frozen at the pack's `ref`. "Update" = bump the ref + re-import
  (idempotent; unchanged skills are skipped, changed ones re-published, upstream-removed ones archived
  on `remove`). The sync engine (tracked mode) is Phase B.
- **Org scope only** in Phase A (team scope needs resolution work — Phase D). Authz: any `org_admin`.

## Admin API (`/v1/admin/skill-packs*`, org_admin, audited)

```
POST   /v1/admin/skill-packs              register { url, ref, config?, authCredentialSlug?, trustTier? }
GET    /v1/admin/skill-packs              list packs + last-import status
GET    /v1/admin/skill-packs/:id/catalog  browse (planIngest: candidates + eligibility + counts)
POST   /v1/admin/skill-packs/:id/import   { selected: "all" | string[] }
PATCH  /v1/admin/skill-packs/:id          edit ref / subset / trustTier / config
DELETE /v1/admin/skill-packs/:id          remove pack + archive its imported skills
```

Or use the **Admin UI → Skill packs** tab (register form, browse with select-all/pick, import, remove).

## Registering a private pack

First vend a read-only deploy token as an org service credential, then register the pack at a pinned
commit.

1. **Vend the deploy token** (Admin UI → Governance → Shared service credentials, or
   `PUT /v1/admin/scopes/org:<org>/service-credentials`): create a credential with a slug like
   `skills-repo-token` whose secret is a GitHub token with read access to the repository.

2. **Register the pack** (Admin UI → Skill packs → Register, or `POST /v1/admin/skill-packs`):

   ```json
   {
     "url": "https://github.com/example/acme-skills",
     "ref": "<pinned commit SHA>",
     "authCredentialSlug": "skills-repo-token",
     "trustTier": "third-party"
   }
   ```

   Personal/missing-scope/private skills and any name colliding with a native skill are excluded
   automatically and shown with their reason in the catalog.

3. **Browse + import**: open the pack, review the candidate list (≈ the company/both skills, minus
   the `publish` collision), and **Import all**. The imported skills appear on the **Skills** page as
   `published`, `createdBy: pack:<id>`, with `pack.commit` provenance.

4. **Updating**: bump the pack `ref` (PATCH) and re-import. Removing the pack archives its skills.

The skills are governed store records, visible and auditable on the admin Skills page, rather than
ungoverned files on each box.

## Loading published skills

The skill index lists each visible skill. The agent's `skills` tool resolves the currently
visible, screened published skill and returns its SKILL.md, or a relative manifest file
named by `path`, without creating or waking a sandbox. Unavailable skills and invalid
paths return no file.

When a skill ships supporting files or pack bundles, the same call lays them into the
turn's private directory under `.agent-turn/<conversation>/skills/<name>/` (packs under
`.packs/<id>/` beside it) and reports that path; the body's own `skills/<name>/` references
are rewritten to it. That directory is wiped when the turn ends and before the next one
starts, so nothing reconciles, locks, or sweeps: plain commands and filesystem reads never
wait on skill synchronization, and revoked or archived content cannot outlive the turn
that loaded it. Publish changes through the skill API to update the source.
